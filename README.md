### Dark+ Contrast Theme

The default Dark+ Visual Studio Code with pure black background color and a few colors made lighter.

I like the default theme, it was just annoying to switch from my nice clearly-looking black terminal to the grayish vscode. I felt like I have vision problems. Code editors shouldn't be gray!

Surprisingly, there was also a hc_black.json theme probably meaning "high contrast black" which was sadly not referenced in the official theme package. It is "unlocked" in this extension too. But I still like Dark+ with added contrast more... :)
