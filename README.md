### Dark+ Contrast Theme

The default Dark+ Visual Studio Code with pure black background color and a few colors made lighter.

I like the default theme, it was just annoying to switch from my nice clearly-looking black terminal to the grayish, poor-contrast Code. I felt like I have a vision problem. Code editors shouldn't be gray!

Surprisingly, there was also a hc_black.json theme file in the default package (probably meaning "high contrast black") which was not referenced at all.

It is now "unlocked" in this extension. But I still like Dark+ with added contrast more... :)

Enjoy!
